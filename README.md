# Assignment Specialized - RNG BP Cut on CM

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/codexlink/randomcmvalueunitgenerator/badge/master)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/codexlink/randomcmvalueunitgenerator/overview/master)

Reason for Creating This: I'm basically tired from my teacher's performance from being BS (Not Intended Use of Word) by giving random activities that are not seem to be helping us at learning from the following subject: Engineering Data Analysis.

## Introduction / Information

I made a Python Script called "RNG BP Cut on CM" which is one of my First Github Repository with OOP Coding Method instead of Procedural Programming. The general goal of this one is to generate data and put it in a format of EXCEL File.

## Features

* Add Data On Excel, One by One, While On Loop Method
* Add nth of Columns for Iteration

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Just do this from Github Desktop or Clone it like literally...

```text
 git clone https://github.com/CodexLink/Python_RNG_EDA_Specialized.git
```

Then run it from any IDE with Python usable installed library.

```text
Open it and run F5. (Yes)
```

### Prerequisites

Here are the things that you need to run the script.

* Python Version 3.5.0
* * Keep in mind that, syntaxes between Python 2.7 and 3.5 are different! So I suggest to go to the latest version one.

### Dependencies

Dependencies required in this repository are already added in the file called `requirements.txt`.

Here are the following dependencies:

* [opnepyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - A Python library to read/write Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm files

If you want to install all dependencies that are potentially added in the near future, just do the following command: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The primary text editor with Github Integration and other such essential stuff.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
